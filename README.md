LaTeX Template for Master thesis

The instruction is specified within the template itself. This template can be used for master theses. I made this template for my own master thesis at Maastricht University to enable separation of writing content from formatting, automation in constructiob of my bibliography and better organisation of technical content.

If you would like to make a change, PRs are welcome.
